# Example environment variables for the ConversAI React frontend
# Copy this file to ".env" and set your Perplexity API key.
# Note: For Create React App, variables must start with REACT_APP_ to be injected at build time.

# Preferred name for CRA:
REACT_APP_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-perplexity-api-key-here

# Optional fallback names supported by the app (not recommended, but tolerated):

# PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-perplexity-api-key-here
